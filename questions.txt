Questions:
1.how does the magic work, is it a digit from 1 to 7(2 ^ 3 - 1) like the challenge?
2.if there is no magic, does the bit change from the first pix?
3.the message only contain words? is there space, digit or other?, if there is the ascii bit has to be the same?

Answers:
1. magic is the password we are going to encrypt our text with. It has nothing to do with challange related stuff
2. with or withouth magic the first bit will be the first bit changed
3. messages can contain words digits spaces everything... there is ascii for digits and spaces too

Questions:
1. Why does it not retrieve the correct bit at decode?

Answers:
1.seems something weird happend in 'img.save( outfilename )' the RGB value changed.

ps:when 'save' image will be compressed, and even change lsb on compressed image's RGB, 'save' still change something, back to the rgb value before change. that is, even can't retrieve correct bit at decode, but the error bit received each time are the same

psps: works good on bmp and png image, still haven't find better solution. another question as below

Questions:
1.about rsa, when two people communicate with each other, they need exchange their public key, right?
2.about step and magic in decrypt, does customer needs to input step in decrypt?(just need magic), if only need magic to decrypt, I guess, in encrypt:
   a.first encrypt magic and step return a token, then use this token to encrypt text(will it be too long?)
   b.step message in the first several pixes(seems not safe)

Answers
1. Yes you encrypt with private key, and give public key to anyone who can then decrypt our message
2. A. Yes step is a bit difficult we could indeed step with the token or magic...
   B. At decrypt this becomes an issue because the decrypter needs to know --magic --step --rgb maybe to much information... Shorter is better
   C. Don't see what you mean with step in first few pixels
