Questions:
1.how does the magic work, is it a digit from 1 to 7(2 ^ 3 - 1) like the challenge?
2.if there is no magic, does the bit change from the first pix?
3.the message only contain words? is there space, digit or other?, if there is the ascii bit has to be the same?

Answers:
1. magic is the password we are going to encrypt our text with. It has nothing to do with challange related stuff
2. with or withouth magic the first bit will be the first bit changed
3. messages can contain words digits spaces everything... there is ascii for digits and spaces too

Answers:
1.seems something weird happend in 'img.save( outfilename )' the RGB value changed.

ps:when 'save' image will be compressed, and even change lsb on compressed image's RGB, 'save' still change something, back to the rgb value before change. that is, even can't retrieve correct bit at decode, but the error bit received each time are the same

psps: works good on bmp and png image, still haven't find better solution. another question as below
